duality of point (a, b) is y = ax - b and duality of line y = ax + b is (a, -b) \\
Properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item p is on l iff l* is in p*
    \item p is in intersection of l1 and l2 iff l1* and l2* lie on p*
    \item Duality preserve vertical distance
    \item Translating a line in primal to moving vertically in dual
    \item Rotating a line in primal to moving a point along a non-vertical line
    \item $li \cap lj$ is a vertex of lower envelope $\Longleftrightarrow$ (li*, lj*) is an edge of upper hull in dual
\end{enumerate}
